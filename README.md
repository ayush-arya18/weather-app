# weather-app
A simple application of node-express and React to fetch weather of any city using open weather api

steps to run the application
Note:- I cannot upload open weather apikey on open github repos so you need to go to openweather website , register for free and obtain your own api key , then copy and paste the api key in app.js file in server folder as 
var apiKey="paste here"

1. open the server folder in your terminal and run the command "npm install"
2. then once all the packages are installed run the command "node app.js" to fire up the server

3. open another window of terminal and open the client folder there , run the command "npm install" again to install all the react packages needed to run the application, once all the packages are installed
4. run the command "npm start" , it will automatically start your web browser and start the react application
